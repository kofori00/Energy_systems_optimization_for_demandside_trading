Traditionally, human beings have relied on fossil fuels to satisfy their energy demands.
Fossil fuels produce carbon emissions to the atmosphere that are endangering our environ-
ment. In an effort to tackle some of these problems, a revolution has been taking place:
the energy transition. In this transformation, to reduce the amount of carbon emissions to
the atmosphere, energy systems are transitioning to renewable energy sources (RES). In this
process, as the generation of RES is highly intermittent and unpredictable, energy storage
has become very important. As nearly 80% of the energy consumption in EU households
is destined to water and space heating, heat storage has become paramount to improve the
efficiency of RES generation. In particular, by storing electricity as heat energy when there is
an excess of RES, and then deploying this heat when there is a shortage of RES, the efficiency
of RES systems can be improved.
Heat Tanks is a company that has multiple heat storage tanks and wants to optimize the
trade of electricity and heat in order to maximize their profits. They hire you as their lead
optimization engineer in order to carry out this task.
After reading the documentation of their systems, you realize that each of these tanks
can be modeled by one state T (t) representing the internal temperature in the tank at time
instant t, two controls Q̇ in (t) and Q̇ out (t) representing the input and output heat to the tank,
and one external disturbance T amb (t) representing the ambient temperature:
