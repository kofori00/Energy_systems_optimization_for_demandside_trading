In this report a cost effective solution is provided for the heat tanks
allocation problem. The provided solution is based on the quadratic
programming method.

### Problem definition

Provided the continuous dynamics of a heat tank which is

\[\frac{dT}{dt}(t)=a_1(T^{amb}(t)-T(t))+a_2(\dot{Q}^{in}(t)-\dot{Q}^{out}(t))
    \label{eq:heat_equation}\]
